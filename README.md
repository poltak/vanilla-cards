# vanilla-cards
Vanilla version of our card game

## Difference

This will essentially be a "dumbed down" version of our final game.

Basic idea is to have a free-to-play, randomised card game (game hand is randomised- players do not collect cards), in the style of other casual free-to-play mobile/JS games.
