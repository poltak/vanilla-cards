# vanilla-cards
Vanilla version of our card game

## Difference

This will essentially be a "dumbed down" version of our final game.

Basic idea is to have a free-to-play, randomised card game (game hand is randomised- players do not collect cards), in the style of other casual free-to-play mobile/JS games.

## Run instructions

Download meteor distribution, cd to project folder, do a "meteor" to run, to reset project do a "meteor reset". The dummy cards are inserted into the mongodb on first run.

## Meteor Mongo

To enter the mongo shell do "meteor mongo". To view the collections do "show collections;".
